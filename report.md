# Report

## This is the report if the issues of this tool

This was a big assignment. I've spend a minimum of 3 weeks in total on this project.

The problems I ran into, were first of all, that you had to look everything up before you could even begin.
The cases and modules were new to me, and it took me a couple of days for reading the documentation and 
search online for more information and video's on the subjects.

### Argparse module

Before this assignment I didn't know what argparse was. The video's and documentation were pretty straight forward
so that wasn't really an issue. It's nice to know that you can do all kinds of things with argparse.

### Datetime module

It was difficult to learn about all the strptime and strftime options. With type() I finally managed to
create working functions.

### CSV module
Before this assignment I didn't know what a .csv file was. I also didn't know that you could open, write and read files with Python. 

### Table module
This is where it got interesting. I couldn't find good documentation how to simply add nice looking tables in the CLI. Only after explanation from someone from the education, I finally managed to add some nice tables.

### Endless possibilities
I also had a hard time with all the different usecases in which you have to account for in your application. Number of things could go wrong, so I had to think of a lot of possibilities what could go wrong.

Let's just say that I learnt a lot last couple of weeks. It was a good exercise.
